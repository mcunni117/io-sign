This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


First you will need to create a .env file by copying the contents of example.env, generate a new project ID from (https://cloud.walletconnect.com/), add it to the .env file.  Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Learn More

For this project I've largely borrowed from Abhik Banerjee's article: https://abhik.hashnode.dev/nextjs-13-using-next-auth-the-web3-way
and related repo: https://github.com/abhik-99/NextJS-Blog

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
